description: Verify a rendered Poppify reel by downloading the MP4, running ffprobe, and extracting sample frames. Use after confirm() returns videoUrl, OR when the user says: "check the video", "verify the reel", "is the render OK", "the video looks wrong", "missing audio", "no music", "no sound", "captions missing", "captions wrong color", "text is wrong color", "wrong duration", "video is too short", "video is too long", "no captions on slide N", or any similar verification / debugging request on a finished Poppify render. Produces a Markdown verdict table.

# Verifying a Poppify render

Once `get_result({ sessionId, apiKey })` returns `status: "complete"` with a `videoUrl`, run this verification BEFORE handing the URL to the user. The signed GCS URL is short-lived (~23h), so verify and inform in one shot.

## Prerequisites

```bash
which ffprobe ffmpeg curl   # all three should exist
```

If ffmpeg/ffprobe are missing: `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS, `apt-get install ffmpeg` on Debian/Ubuntu.

## Step 1 — Download the MP4

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/poppify-verify
curl -sL "$VIDEO_URL" -o /tmp/poppify-verify/render.mp4
ls -l /tmp/poppify-verify/render.mp4   # should be ≥ 200KB for a 15s reel
```

If the file is < 50KB, the URL is likely expired or the render produced an empty file — re-call `get_result` to confirm `status` is still `complete` and `videoUrl` is current.

## Step 2 — ffprobe for the structural verdict

```bash
ffprobe -v error -print_format json -show_streams -show_format /tmp/poppify-verify/render.mp4
```

Check these fields against expectations:

| Question | Where to look | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| Has video? | `streams[].codec_type === "video"` | h264, 720x1280, ~24fps |
| Has audio? | `streams[].codec_type === "audio"` | aac, sample_rate 44100 or 48000 |
| Duration | `format.duration` | matches session.duration (`15s` / `30s` / `60s`) within ±0.5s |
| Resolution | `streams[0].width` x `streams[0].height` | 720x1280 (vertical) |

If audio stream is missing: the session's `selectedAudio` likely had an empty `resolvedUrl`. Check `get_result`'s response for the session's audio attach state.

## Step 3 — Extract sample frames

Extract one frame per second to a thumbs directory:

```bash
ffmpeg -y -i /tmp/poppify-verify/render.mp4 -vf "fps=1" /tmp/poppify-verify/frame_%03d.png 2>/dev/null
ls /tmp/poppify-verify/frame_*.png
```

Read each frame with the Read tool (it accepts PNG paths) and verify visually:

- **Caption present?** Text should appear on most slides (recipe controls which beats get captions). Empty caption on a slide is a deliberate `set_text({newText:""})` patch — not a bug.
- **Caption color matches request?** If user asked for `textColor: "#FFFFFF"` and you see another color, the schema-drop bug returned — file via `submit_feedback`.
- **Caption position matches `textAnimation`?** typewriter → top-center, bold_captions → middle, phrase_reveal → bottom-left.
- **Image content matches slides[i] intent?** If a slide's `voiceoverShort` says "before" but the image is the "after" frame, the visual edits queue may have applied in wrong order.

## Step 4 — Produce a verdict for the user

Output a small Markdown table:

```markdown
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Video stream | ✅ h264 720x1280 @ 24fps |
| Audio stream | ✅ aac 44.1kHz, 30.0s |
| Duration | ✅ matches session.duration=30s |
| Caption color | ✅ matches request (#FFFFFF) |
| Caption position | ✅ bottom-left (phrase_reveal) |
| All slides have captions | ⚠️ slide 3 has no caption (intentional? check session.slides[3].voiceoverShort) |
```

If everything is green, hand the URL to the user with a note that it expires in ~23h. If anything is red, surface the specific failure and offer to re-render with a corrected patch.

## Common failure patterns

- **Audio stream missing.** Library audio attached without resolution OR `set_audio` was called with an `assetId` that's no longer in the library. Resolution: call `get_music_library` for a fresh asset list, then `set_audio` again, then `confirm` again.
- **Duration drift > 1s.** Usually means slides ended up with very short `voiceoverShort` text and the renderer's text-driven duration computed below the recipe minimum. Resolution: write longer text on slides via `update_slides set_text`.
- **Wrong caption color.** If `textColor` was requested but not applied, the MCP customize schema may be stale. Re-check current build via `poppify-schema-introspect` skill.
- **Captions baked into the image AND drawn by composer (double text).** Don't render text-heavy slides via `generate_image` — the model bakes text into the image AND composer adds drawtext on top. Use HTML/CSS screencap + `upload_asset` instead, and pass `update_slides({action:"set_text",newText:""})` to skip composer text for that slide.

## Cleanup

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/poppify-verify
```
